# simple-calculator-in-C

This is a simple console application in C to simulate simple calculator.


The program takes 3 input from the user:
1. First number
2. Second number
3. An operation to perform on these number

Almost every case was handled and, if there's anything not handled yet feel free to comment or let me know and I'll try to be working more and more to enhance my implementations.

The user enter the first number, the program checks it as number or not and, the second one finally, the third one is the operation and it's done.
